Software Description:

GottaHabit is an iOS application designed to help users manage habits. The app has two main modes, one that sets daily reminders e.g. 
take the dog for a walk, and another than sets reminders on a reoccuring timer for shorter periods e.g take a break from sitting down
every 30 minutes. 

Running Instructions:

The HabitManager folder contains a xcodeproj file that can be run in Xcode. The default deployment target is iOS 10.0.
The app can be run on a physical iPhone or a simulator running iOS 10.0 or later.

General Comments:

We have found a bug that causes an extra notification to occur when turning off and on a reoccuring timer. This only occurs on the
university computers that run xcode 8.2.1. We could not replicate this but on later versions of xcode or on a physical iphone.
Occasionally the simulator may not reproduce the rotational behaviour that we have seen on a physical device.
